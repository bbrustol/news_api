I tried to write a project as clean as I could, using the best practices in 2023 in base of SOLID.

- unidirectional flow
- Jetpack Compose
- coroutines flow with StateFlow
- It's prepared for Light/dark mode
- MVVM architecture and I decided to not use the Domain layer in this project.
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
- Gradle plugins
- Flavor in a sub module
- unit tests with MockK
- this project is accessible.

I hope you are enjoying the project.
